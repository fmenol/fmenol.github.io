## Why Model?

Before we can control a biological system, we need to understand its dynamics. Mathematical models serve two crucial purposes:

1. **Prediction**: What will the cell do given a particular input?
2. **Control design**: How should we adjust our input to achieve a goal?

## The Central Dogma as ODEs

Gene expression can be described by ordinary differential equations. For a simple gene:

```
dM/dt = α(u) - δ_m × M
dP/dt = β × M - δ_p × P
```

Where:
- `M` is mRNA concentration
- `P` is protein concentration
- `α(u)` is the transcription rate (our control input)
- `β` is the translation rate
- `δ_m`, `δ_p` are degradation rates

## Hill Functions

Transcriptional regulation often follows a sigmoidal response. The Hill function captures this:

```python
def hill_function(x, K, n):
    """
    x: inducer/repressor concentration
    K: half-saturation constant
    n: Hill coefficient (cooperativity)
    """
    return x**n / (K**n + x**n)
```

Higher Hill coefficients give sharper switching behavior—useful for building digital-like circuits, but harder to control smoothly.

## Stochasticity

At low molecule numbers, deterministic models break down. Gene expression is fundamentally stochastic:

- **Intrinsic noise**: Random fluctuations in transcription/translation
- **Extrinsic noise**: Cell-to-cell variability in cellular machinery

For cybergenetics, noise is both a challenge (perturbing our setpoint) and an opportunity (feedback can suppress noise).

## Parameter Estimation

Real models need real parameters. Common approaches:

1. **Literature values**: Start with published parameters
2. **Step responses**: Apply input steps, fit dynamics
3. **System identification**: Sophisticated input signals + ML

The goal isn't a perfect model—it's a model good enough for control design.

## Conclusion

Mathematical modeling bridges theory and experiment in cybergenetics. In the next post, we'll see how these models inform the design of feedback controllers.
